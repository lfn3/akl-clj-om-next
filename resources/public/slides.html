                <h3>Who am I ?!</h3>
                <p>Developer, here (liveops), doing automated testing stuff</p>
                <p>We only get to do cljs in our spare time atm</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>What's figwheel?</h3>
                <p>A cljs library for hot code loading</p>
                <p>The magic is it keeps app state between reloads</p>
                <p>Great with any app that keeps it's state in one place</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>What's devcards?</h3>
                <p>Put all your app's states on one page</p>
                <p>Let's you get started and experiment way quicker</p>
                <p>Great for testers, stakeholders etc.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>Both of these can work outside the cljs ecosystem</p>
                <p>... but they're less useful, and more finnickity.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Assumed knowledge</h3>
                <p>Know what react is, and have an idea of how it works</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>A bit of history</h3>
                <p>Why not om.now?</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>Cursors are hard</p>
                <p>Also, other people made shiny things</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Relay</h3>
                <p>Query colocation</p>
                <p>GraphQL</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Falcor</h3>
                <p>Identity / normalization</p>
                <p>Routing on the client</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>These ideas are synthesized with the parser</p>
                <p>Which is mostly what we're going to be playing with for the structured part of tonight</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>What is the parser?</h3>
                <p>Responsible for pulling apart your query</p>
                <p>You get to write your own!</p>
                <p>But you might not want to</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Database and normalization</h3>
                <p>Om has opinions about state</p>
                <p>Keep data in a normalized form (idents)</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Reconciler? Whut?</h3>
                <p>Part through which all state flows</p>
                <p>Contains state, parser and remotes</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>There's a lot of stuff I've glossed over or elided</p>
                <p>It's still early days yet, things are subject to change</p>
                <p>APIs are still rough and unfinished</p>
            </section>
